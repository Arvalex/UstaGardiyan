This project is one of the Spigot-Bukkit server plugins developed for the game Minecraft.

It is an animated banning system with the Guardian in the game. 
It is used with the command "**/ug player time(sn, dk, sa, gün)**". 
I know time types are not familiar at all. The meanings can be translated sequentially as sec, min, hr, day. 
I coded it according to my language, Turkish. Some files and variables in the project are also in Turkish. 
But it's very easy to understand(maybe just for me :D).
